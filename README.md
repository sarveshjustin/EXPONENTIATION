# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:

Developed by:sarvesh.s

RegisterNumber: 22003029
```
n1 = int(input()) 
n2 = int(input()) 
c = n1**2
print("Exponentiation of a given number:", c) 

```

## Output:
